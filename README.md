Daily Growth Mindset Stand up / Stand down

## Ass-kicking

### "Seek to get your ass kicked, if you dont you cant grow. You cant grow if you dont challenge yourself."

### "When youre getting your ass kicked, learn from it instead of getting emotional about it, unless youre just having a good time... then enjoy yourself."

### "Seek to kick ass because if you dont youll never gain from what was lost. Youll never win from losing. Seek to be even."

### "When youre kicking ass, dont get cocky about it, unless youre just having a good time... then enjoy yourself."

## Perspective

### Perspective is like a big gigantic bowl of candy, you and all your friends only had time to grab one before the next new cool thing came along. The candy was so sweet, tasted so good that you wanted to know how your friends candy tasted. But they cant tell you really, all they can describe is that it was sweet and tasty also. But for all time, you never can experience the same candy anyone else does because the perspective of it is yours and yours only.

## Meaning

### Meaning is a double edged sword. Its best to take meaning without emotion. The best meaning meant that you took the other persons meaning without your emotion but allowed yourself to take theirs.

## Follow through

## Learning

### When you're just starting out:

```
I know how it is man, I was there one day getting frustrated with this stuff like you.
I still get frustrated but its not the same
The noob frustration is the worst because you are just beginning to see how to understand other people who are helping you.
But trust me it goes away over time.
```

```
I know you feel better, I see, you have grown...  but now that you think you're a total badass.
I can only take so much, if you really knew the entire time, you never needed anyone to show you the way.
Please show me how, dive onto the highest limb of the tree, dance out to the very end of it and see if you fall.
Go on and tell everyone how you never needed them, you can handle all that comes at you,
Go on and believe that you are now in competition with Him and the one who showed you His way.
Please give me some time to boil and when I boil I will sear this shit off of you.
If you are of the fixed mindset, you are arrogant, you are a know-it-all
You cant have anyone teach you and you cant learn.
Here we go, you have grown and now you feel good, now you feel that you dont want to grow more.
You stay here, you stay as FIXED MINDSET.
```

## Ego

### Only One can be a fixed mindset, the rest of us are growing. One doesnt grow and cant grow, One has already grown. Try not to get yourself confused with Him or else you will stop being like him. He is the path and you never stop walking.

## Trust

## Path

## Policies

## Seeing

### Approaching the world as a blind man means you only have yourself in sight. It is possible to become so blinded by yourself, by what you feel and your own ego that you only ever see yourself throughout life. Everything you do is in consideration only to you never with your feelings aside. When you push how you feel aside, you're pushing yourself out of the way. Its the bridge to connect to other people.
