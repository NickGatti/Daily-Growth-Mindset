Daily Growth Mindset Stand up / Stand down

## Ass-kicking

### "Seek to get your ass kicked, if you dont you cant grow. You cant grow if you dont challenge yourself."

### "When youre getting your ass kicked, learn from it instead of getting emotional about it, unless youre just having a good time... then enjoy yourself."

### "Seek to kick ass because if you dont youll never gain from what was lost. Youll never win from losing. Seek to be even."

### "When youre kicking ass, dont get cocky about it, unless youre just having a good time... then enjoy yourself."

## Perspective

### Perspective is like a big gigantic bowl of candy, you and all your friends only had time to grab one before the next new cool thing came along. The candy was so sweet, tasted so good that you wanted to know how your friends candy tasted. But they cant tell you really, all they can describe is that it was sweet and tasty also. But for all time, you never can experience the same candy anyone else does because the perspective of it is yours and yours only.

## Meaning

### Meaning is a double edged sword. Its best to take meaning without emotion. The best meaning meant that you took the other persons meaning without your emotion but allowed yourself to take theirs.

## Follow through

## Learning

### When you're just starting out:

```
I know how it is man, I was there one day getting frustrated with this stuff like you.
I still get frustrated but its not the same
The noob frustration is the worst because you are just beginning to see how to understand other people who are helping you.
But trust me it goes away over time.
